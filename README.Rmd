*The `micp` package implements variational Bayesian inference for the classification accuracy in hierarchical data.*

## Introduction

Classification algorithms are often used in a hierarchical setting, where a classifier is trained and tested on individual datasets which are themselves sampled from a group. Examples of this sort of analysis are ubiquitous and are common in domains as varied as spam detection, brain-machine interfaces, and neuroimaging.

This R package provides answers to the questions of statistical inference that arise in all of these settings. It implements models that account for both within-subjects (fixed-effects) and between-subjects (random-effects) variance components and thus provide mixed-effects inference.

The package is extremely easy to use and requires no prerequisites other than R.

## Installation

You can install the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kaybrodersen/micp")
```
